{:toc}
{: .toc}


##Overview

Currently there isn't a preprocessor of choice used at [Obecto]. The aim of this styleguide is to have these rules apply to [CSS], [Sass] and Less.

We will use stuff from [BEM], [SMACSS] and a little bit of [Atomic Design]. Rather than adhering 100% to these techniques, we shall make our own, customized one.

There are really good documents right now on this exact problem. At the end of this styleguide there will be list with recommended reading.

There should be further discussion over the use of [Grunt.js] and [Gulp]

##How to write our declarations

By having rules for the syntax and formatting we can easily scan our [CSS] (and template) files. Here's the general outline:

+ Two (2) spaces for indentation; no tabs (don't kill me)
+ Multi-line [CSS]
+ Opening brace ```{``` is on the same line as the last property
+ Closing brace ```}``` is alone on a new line, after the last declaration.
+ Appropriate usage of whitespace

###First things first: the introduction
When we start a new [SCSS] or Less file we must have a small introduction in the beginning. Say what this file is for:

+ Variables files
+ Base styles
+ A certain "block"
+ Etc.

The idea is to give a general idea to the developer what the file is for and what the things inside it do.

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*\
**  Signals Graph
**
**  The purpose of this graph is to highlight when you are coming
**  to a meaningful decision for your product based on the signals
**  you have
**
\*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
~~~

``signals-graph.scss``

This is the introductionary block for the ``signals-graph.scss`` from the [Signal.ly] project. Let's break things down.

First, we start of with a "frame". It's 70 columns wide. The purpose for this is that the comments we write should not be more than 70 characters on a single line. That helps readability.
After the first line we insert an empty line starting with two asterisks.

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*\
**
~~~

We start every new line with two asterisks.

~~~
**  The purpose of this graph is to highlight when you are coming
**  to a meaningful decision for your product based on the signals
**  you have
~~~

After the comment we add another empty line and finish of the comment with the closing "frame".

~~~
**
\*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
~~~

###Titles

Titles are one of the first things that a newbie [CSS] developer must incorporate into his code writing. They help us scan our code easier. If we know the section's name we can directly go to it by searching for the title. Combined with a ToC and a set naming convention we can just copy the title's number and jump to the code that we want to look at/edit. Findability is key!

It is the responsibility of every developer to set the title for every block of code and number it accordingly. Then, edit the ToC at the beginning of the file.

We write the title between the two comment title frames, start with two asterisks (**), followed by a "tab".

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  #Signal strength bars wrapper
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.strength {
  display: flex;
  height: 7em;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: stretch;
  align-content: stretch;
  align-self: flex-start;
  min-height: 50%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style-type: none;

}

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  #Signal strength column
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.strength-column {
  flex-basis: auto;
  flex: 1;
  //End flex
  position: relative;
  border: 1px solid #f0f0f0;
  border-bottom: none;
  color: @color-charcoal;
  text-align: center;

  .fa,
  .icon,
  .strentgth-column__hash {
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    top: 2px;
    z-index: 5;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .strentgth-column__hash {
    display: block;
  }

  .icon {
    width: 1em;
  }
}
~~~

###On commenting
To set things straight, so there is no confusion - **we need comments in our [CSS] files**.
When writing our styles we know what we do, because of whatever reasons. We should identify caveats in the code and document them. Why is this floated? Why does it clear floats? Why the positioning property? And so on, and so on.

As we are using preprocessors, the comments should be on the same line as the declaration. Use the preprocessors inline comments ```//```, one tab after the closing ```;```

If we are writing vanilla [CSS], we use the normal comment ``/**/``

~~~
.container {
  width: 980px;
  margin: 0 auto; //horizontal centering
  background: #eee;
  overflow: hidden; //clear floats

  .sub-module {
    float: left;  //Float submodules so they align on one line
    width: 25%;
    padding: 0.5em 1em;
  }
}
~~~

~~~
.dropdown-container {
  display: inline-block;
  @extend %clearfix;  //use clearfix because of elements appear outside of the container (dropdowns and box-shadows)
}
~~~
Here is an example where we comment the different ways of clearing floats, among other things.

One thing to note is that these inline comments don't cross to our processed [CSS] code.

Some people like to put "END Comments" in their CSS, where a long block of code ends. Like so:

~~~
  ...

  .fa,
  .icon,
  .strentgth-column__hash {
    width: 100%;
    position: relative;
    top: 2px;
    z-index: 5;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .strentgth-column__hash {
    display: block;
  }

  .icon {
    width: 1em;
  }
}
//END .strength-column
~~~

We don't...

###Prefixes
We don't write with prefixes, we use [autoprefixer]

###Pseudo-elements and pseudo-selectors
Just a notice that we write:

~~~
.element::before

.element::after

.element::first-line

.element::first-letter
~~~

and

~~~
.element:nth-of-type()

.element:nth-child()

.element:no()

...
~~~

See where we write `::` or `:`

You can read a lot about pseudo selectors and elements at [CSS Tricks's article]

###Element selectors
We don't use element selectors, combined with classnames. Also know as qualified selectors

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Wrong
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
ul.nav{
  list-style-type: none;
}
~~~

In smaller projects, which are not prone to change, we could still element selectors in some of the more well-known situations. Let's continue with the navigation example

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Navigation
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.nav {
  display: block;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  list-style-type: none;

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 0.25em 0.75em;
    border-bottom: 2px solid transparent

    &:hover
    &.active {
      border-bottom-color: cornflowerblue;
    }
  }
}
~~~

###Dealing with the zer0
When a property has a value of '0' don't put any unit after it

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Correct
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element {
  padding-right: 0;
  padding-left: 0;
}



/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Wrong
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element {
  padding-right: 0px;
  padding-left: 0px;
}
~~~

We always use a leading zero and never use a trailing zero

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Correct
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element {
  font-size: 2em;
  opacity: 0.5;
}



/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Wrong
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element {
  font-size: 2.0em;
  opacity: .5;
}
~~~


##Formatting our rulesets
This is maybe one of the most discussed topics in the [CSS] developer's world. There is not a standard way of writing code, actually there are several "schools" and ways developers write and order their code. It depends on the developer's taste how he writes his code, but in an environment with several developers working on one codebase, we should apply rules and conventions.

###Multi-line CSS and { }
We write multi-line [CSS], with each declaration on a separate line, with the opening brace ```{``` being on the same line as the last property (.class, element or [attribute]). The closing brace ```}``` is on the last line, alone. The first property is on a new line after the opening ```{``` The indentation is two spaces.

After each property we place the colon ```:``` with a space between the colon and the value.

~~~
.classname {
  property: value;
  property: 0;
}
~~~

We don't leave out the closing semi-colon ```;```

###Indentation &amp; nesting
One of the best things about preprocessors is the ability to nest elements inside others, and so you can mimic the markup structure. But if you nest too much, the code will bite you in the ass and you will loose track of [rule specificity].
The rule of thumb is nest maximum three leves in. In your markup place reusable classes as much as you can, do not overdo it, ofcourse.

Modifiers of blocks and elements are placed last in the order of the rulesets for the block or element. They can be nested, depending on the specificity situation.

In the real world the project that we are currently working on may require us to nest elements deeply. We should try and avoid it, but if nothing else works - we are free to do it. It's better to make something work, than to release something that 'almost' works, just because of semantics.
Usually other developers think about pseudo-elements and pseudo-selectors as a separate level of nesting. Me - I don't acutally care much about them, and I would nest ```:hover```s and ```:before```s three and four levels deep.

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
    Wrong
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.parent {
  ...

  .parent-element {
    ...

    .child {
      ...

      .child-element {

        .child-element__modifier {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}



/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Correct
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/

.parent {
  ...
}

.parent-element {
  ...

  .child {
    Code specific to the "child" being nested in "parent-element".
    Like overriding box-sizing, colors etc.
  }
}

.child {
  ...
}

.child-element {
  ...
}

.child-element__modifier {
  ...
}
~~~

Basically our goal is to write every element like root in the [SCSS] stylesheet. Once we have codes that are being overrwriten by the parent, we add the rules for that child nested inside the parent element.
Nesting may seem cool, but also it's really powerful. So much, that it can cause the unseasond developer a lot of ``!important`` headaches. And we don't use ``!important``

A "real-world" example:

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  #The phrases
**  Phrases are the interviewee's answers
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.phrases-holder {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  #Phrases single item
**  One answer by the interviewee
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.phrases-item {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  margin: .5em 0 0.8em;

  /*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
  **  #Phrases text
  **  The actual text of the phrase
  \~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
  .phrases-item__text {
    flex: 2;
    margin: 0 0 0 1em;
    padding: 1em 1em .75em;
    border-bottom: .25em solid darken(@color-cottage, 10%);
    position: relative;
    background-color: @color-cottage;
    color: #333;

    //Make the traingle
    &:before {
      content: '';
      display: block;
      width: 0;
      height: 0;
      border-top: .5em solid transparent;
      border-right: .5em solid @color-cottage;
      border-bottom: .5em solid transparent;
      position: absolute;
      top: 20%;
      left: -0.5em;
      z-index: 5;
    }
  }
}
~~~

There is the practice to indent our declarations to represent them like in the DOM:

~~~
.element {
  ...
}

  .element__header {
      ...
  }
~~~

This is not needed. While coding the developer will be looking at the template code and he will know the structure of the element he is working on. It's possible to indent declarations like that if we're working on vanilla [CSS] or it just serves the purpose to show the developer's idea better. Please comment if so.

###Whitespace
In our stylesheets, and also in our templates, we should make use of whitespace do distinguish between autonomous and connected blocks of code. Especially when scrolling up and down. Generally we want to have an empty line between blocks of code. There is no empty lines after the title block for the ruleset

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Block
**  This block is for something
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.block {
  display: block;
}

.element-name {
  border: 2px solid gold;
}

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Block element
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.block__element {
  float: left;
  margin: 1em;
}

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Element2
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element2 {
  display: inline-block;
}
~~~

###Shorthand properties, units, keywords, HEX, RGB

####Shorthand properties
We use shorthands after we have to declare three or more values for the same property.

~~~
/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Correct
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
.element {
  padding-right: 0.5em;
  padding-left: 0.5em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
  background: url('../img/bg/1.jpg') no-repeat 50% 50%;
  border: 1px red solid;
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

/*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
**  Wrong
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/
element{
  margin: 0 0 0 20px;
  padding: 0.5em 0 1em;
  background: #bada55;
  animation-name: bounce;
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
  animation-delay: 0.15s;
  animation-timing-function:
}
~~~

####Units
We don't use units when a value is `0`

~~~
element {
  margin-top: 0;  //value is zero, so need for '%' or 'px'
  margin-bottom: 20px;  //0 < px
}
~~~

####HEX
We write hex color values with lowercase characters and when use shorthands when we are able to

~~~
element {
  border-color: #af0;
  color: #bada55;
}
~~~

####RGB
We write the RGB values with a space after each comma, the opacity value starts with a zero, before the decimal point, always with the alpha channel.

~~~
element {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(186, 218, 85, 0.9);
}
~~~

###Declaration order
One of the most important things to have to maintain a consistent and tidy codebase is to order our declarations in a strict order. While the developper is building his new feature, he can order the decarations any way he pleases, but before a commit he has to make sure that they are in the specific order. There is a new tool [scss-lint] that can help us do that and automate this task for our [SCSS] files. You can look at some examples of declaration alignment in the project's [property sort order] files.

Here is our order:

~~~
#floats
float
clear

#display
display
vertical-align

#box
width
min-width
max-width

height
min-height
max-height

#line-height for verical centering

~~~

When working in the [SCSS] file there is no need to have empty lines between the declarations. Here the whitespace is used to group the different declarations by meaning.

Some odd things... As you can see ``line-height`` is way up at the top. That's because it's mostly used (in my experience) for vertical centering. That's why I have come to group it more with the height value.

The ``overflow`` declaration is always at the bottom. Only if there are ``transform``, ``animation`` or ``transition``, they appear after ``overflow``.

One might think that this is hard to get used to, but actually it's pretty straight-forward. There is maybe maximum a day of getting used to the desired declaration order.

If we are styling a pseudo-element, we always start off with the `content`

~~~
.element::before {
  conetnt: '';
  display: inline-block;
  width: 10em;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: -100%;
}
~~~

###Multiple classes
When we have declared several classes that share the same properties we shuold place related classes on the same line, and unrelated classes on a new line

~~~
.btn, .btn--large, .btn--small,
.box,
.quote {
  border: 1px solid gold;
  background-color: #eee;
  color: #222;
}
~~~
The buttons are related to eachother, as the other elements are unrelated - they appear on new lines.

###Properties with multiple declarations
The are some properties that allow for multiple value declarations such as ```text-shadow```, ```transition```, ```animation``` and others. We write each new value on a new line. The closing ```;``` is on the end of the last line;

~~~
.btn-rainbow {
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 0 red,
              2px 2px 0 blue,
              3px 3px 0 green,
              4px 4px 0 yellow;
}
~~~

##Namespacing
Namespacing comes from [SMACSS] and the chapter ['Naming Rules'](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing). We are directly going to pich the `.is-` state namespace.

Here is a list of namespaces that we can use

~~~
.u-   //Utility class; .u-text--large; .u-clearfix

.is-  //State class; .is-hidden

.t-   //Theming class; .t-grey-light

.js-  //JS hooks; These don't appear in our CSS files and are only used by JS Devs

$.c-  //Namespace for color variables; LESS: @c-
~~~

~~~
<div class="modal is-hidden">
  <form>
    <input type="email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-action is-deactivated">Sign up for our newsletter</button>
  </form>
</div>
