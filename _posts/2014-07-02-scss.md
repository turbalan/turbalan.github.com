##Introduction
For the most part of dealing with conventions of writing good [SCSS] or [Less], the [SASS guidelines] have got you covered. Here we will outline just some of the more basic stuff wee need to watch out for.

##UTF-8
Always set `@charset 'utf-8';` at the top of every SCSS file.

##@extend
Ok, first read about [@extend]. And the suggested reading too...

Done? OK. So now you know that we never `@extend .selectors;`. We only ever `@extend %placehoders;`. In [Less] we never `&:extend()`. It sucks. If you feel the need to use `&:extend()` just add the classname to the HTML element you are styling. If there are many thing to override, the selector you're extending isn't quite the reusable code you thought it would be.

Now then, after all this information you're still keen on extending something. Remember that we put `@extend` at the very top of our declaration and continue to style the element from there on. We have an empty line after it.

~~~
.content {
  @extend %clearfix;

  width: 780px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
~~~

##@mixin
Mixins are great and are probably the most used feature of CSS preprocessors. A general rule is to keep your mixin light, avoid having too much of a complex logic. Mixins can be `@included` anywhere in the order of your declaration, just be sure to leave empty lines aroung it.

##The responsive web and breakpoints
I really like Hugo's [breakpoint manager]. We should use it for our responsive designs.

I really don't like "device-specific" breakpoints as in my mind the content breaks at different points and we should design for those breakpoints. One should read [Breakpoints and Tweakpoints in Sass]. The ideas for custom 'tweakpoints' for specific elements is a great one. I will paste the code from Hugo's example here. All credit goes to him.

~~~
///http://www.sitepoint.com/breakpoints-tweakpoints-sass/ by Hugo Giraudel
/// Breakpoints/tweakpoints manager
/// @param {String} $point - Breakpoint/tweakpoint name
@mixin respond-to($point) {
  @if map-has-key($tweakpoints, $point) {
    @media (min-width: map-get($tweakpoints, $point)) {
      @content;
    }
  } @else if map-has-key($breakpoints, $point) {
    @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, $point)) {
      @content;
    }
  } @else {
    @warn "Could not find `#{$breakpoint}` in both local ($tweakpoints) and global ($breakpoints) contexts. Media block omitted.";
  }
}

/// Component wrapper
/// @param {Map} $component-tweakpoints [()] - Component tweakpoints
@mixin component($component-tweakpoints: ()) {
  $tweakpoints: $component-tweakpoints !global;
  @content;
  $tweakpoints: () !global;
}
~~~
