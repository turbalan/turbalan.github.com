#Purpose of this style guide

The purose of this document is to unify the ways that we write CSS code at [Obecto]. The topics that it will try to cover are:

+ how we write our rulesets (comments; whitespace; declaration order)
+ syntax (spaces/tabs; indentation etc.)
+ meaningful names for our classes in the HTML
+ modularizing our code - identifying single stand-alone elements; combining them to form a module;
+ creating templates from different modules
+ breaking up code in different files and folders (Preproccessor style)
+ importing our separate files to form a unified stylesheet

##Before we set forth
Please, before you continue to read this styleguide take the time to read [SMACSS] by [Jonathan Snook], the [CSS guidelines] by [Harry Roberts] and the [SASS guidelines] by [Hugo Giraudel]. They are a great resource, with a lot of useful information to give you the proper attitude towards developing the frontend. This guideline in its core is inspired by them and most of the information inside you could get from reading these guides.

##OK!
This document is by no means final and will be perpatually changing. Its purpose is not to be a full-blown document on how to code, but setup something of a framework to work within. The final goal is to have a real styleguide, that we will work with on every project we have here at Obecto. **Let's get crackin'!**
